# Animal Shelter Telegram Bot

## Project Description

This project is a Telegram bot developed by Dev Pro, an international company specializing in developing solutions for companies looking to automate customer communication processes.

The animal shelter in Astana has approached us for help. They want to assist people who are considering adopting a dog or a cat. For many of their clients, this is their first experience, and the number of inquiries they receive daily is so high that they cannot process them manually.

The shelter management has asked us to create a Telegram bot that can answer common questions people have about what they need to know and do to adopt an animal from the shelter.

Additionally, the shelter volunteers request new owners to send a daily report for a month about how the animal is adapting to the new environment. The client also asked the bot to handle this part of the work.
